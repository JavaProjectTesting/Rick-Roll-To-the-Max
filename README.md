# Rick-Roll-To-the-Max-
a trolley java project!

Using GUI it can make any song super annoying by opening up loads of tabs.

*Able to enter how many tabs you want open
*Able to pick witch song you want by just coping the URL
*Able to have a delay in the song
________________________________________________________________________________
This just opens a load of tabs corisponding to the options that you put in.
